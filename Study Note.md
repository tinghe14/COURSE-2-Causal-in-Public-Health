## W1P1: Intro and Framework
GOAL: 
- define casual effects and "the effect of a cause" vs "the cause of an effect", potential outcomes, assignment mechanism
- define estimands, including average treatment effects and average treatment effects for the treated.

## W1P2: Discussion of "The C word", and Randomized Experiments
GOAL:
- basics of randomized exepriments: unconfounded assignment mechanisms, efficacy and effectiveness trials, cluster-based designs, increases in power when pretest measure of outcome available (eg: for use to calculate gain scores)
- concepts of internal, external, and target validity

## W2P1: Observational Studies and the Importance of Design
GOAL:
- careful selection of comparison units and data
- dangers of regression on unmatched samples and assumptions underlying regression adjustment in non experimental studies
- definition and intuition behind propensity scores

## W2P2: Introduction to Propensity Scores
GOAL:
- The theory underlying propensity scores
- basic steps in a propensity score analysis
- basic of propensity score matching, weighting, and subclassification

## W3P1: Implementation of matching and related methods

## W3P2: Assessing sensitivity to an unobserved confounder
